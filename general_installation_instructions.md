<p>
  Java OceanAtlas (JOA) is a computer application written in Java.  JOA and its
  support files must be installed on your computer.  JOA cannot be opened/run
  from removable media such as a CD or DVD, nor can it be opened/run over a
  network.
</p>

<p>
 Installing JOA is accomplished by mainly unzipping a zip file or disk image on macOS or launching the JOA installer on Windows. See the platform specific installation instructions. A JOA installation is composed of the JOA application and its support files in a single folder/directory.
</p>

<p>Once you have installed JOA, you should have a folder/directory on your
computer with these contents:</p>
<p>Mac</p>
<div class="image">
  <img alt="List of folders: bathymetry, coastlines, Example Data Files, Java OceanAtlas 5.0, JOA_Support, lexicon.txt, ndeditsettings.txt, temp"
       src="assets/images/general_install_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>Windows</p>
<div class="image">
  <img alt="List of folders: bathymetry, coastlines, Example Data Files, Java OceanAtlas 5.0, JOA_Support, lexicon.txt, ndeditsettings.txt, temp"
       src="assets/images/general_install_2.jpg">
</div>

<p>
  Most of these are essential - the JOA application itself will not run without
  information it looks for in some of the other files - and so all must be
  co-located in the same folder/directory on your computer.

<h4>Bathymetry Add-ins</h4>
<p>
  If you would like to add higher-resolution ETOPO files, download any or all
  of these files and unzip them into the JOA_Support folder/subdirectory on
  your computer.
</p>
<p>
  Java OceanAtlas contains ETOPO-60 and ETOPO-20 files. These are binary files
  extracted from ETOPO-5 with bathymetry and elevations at 5-minute spatial
  resolution.
