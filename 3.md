<p>Plots are the heart of the application. One of the first questions you might have would be &lsquo;where are these data located?&rsquo; Java OceanAtlas includes station maps.<br><br>
	Select &lsquo;Map...&rsquo; from the Plots menu. The will bring up the Configure Map Plot dialog box. 
	<br><br>
	We have configured the dialog boxes for each JOA plot type so that a basic plot can be made with a minimum of user input. 
	<br><br>
	For a JOA map plot, no further user inputs are required: the &lsquo;Plot&rsquo; button is activated, meaning a basic map plot will be drawn by clicking on the &lsquo;Plot&rsquo; button.
	<br><br>
	In this Guided Tour we show some basic plot customization features:<br><br>
	Select the &lsquo;Miller&rsquo; projection from the scrollable list of projections.
	<br><br>
	Select the &lsquo;Central Atlantic&rsquo; preset region. In the 'Latitude spacing (deg)&rsquo; and Longitude spacing (deg)&rsquo; boxes select the pre-set text and type in '10&rsquo; and '20&rsquo;, respectively. Java OceanAtlas maps include default bathymetry based on the ETOPO60 one-degree coarse grid: click the 'bathymetry&rsquo; tab to see this (on a new copy of JOA it is set up this way by default). The dialog box should look like the examples in Figure 2.

<p>Then click 'Plot'. You will see a map with the stations, shaded land masses, gray bathymetry, and a latitude/longitude grid, as shown in Figure 3.

Map plots show individual dots for each station, with a different station color for each section subset. (JOA determines this coloring for reasons mostly ignored here, for example when there is more than one section opened.) In Figure 3 the apparent 'cruise line' is actually a series of 80 individual station dots. The map window is scrollable and resizable. (You may need to click on the 'Reset' button in the map plot window to force a redraw.) Selecting a subset of the plot by click-dragging the cursor will produce a subset of the map plot covering only the selected area. [Sometimes, due to a Java quirk, the new map subset plot is initially hidden under the original map plot window.]</p>
