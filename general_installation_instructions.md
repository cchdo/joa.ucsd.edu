		<h1>Java OceanAtlas Application</h1>
		<h2>{{page.title}}</h2>
		<p> Java OceanAtlas (JOA) is a computer application written in Java. JOA and its support files must be installed on your computer. JOA cannot be opened/run from removable media such as a CD or DVD, nor can it be opened/run over a network. </p>
		<p> Installing JOA is accomplished by mainly unzipping a zip file or disk image on macOS or launching the JOA installer on Windows. See the platform specific installation instructions. A JOA installation is composed of the JOA application and its support files in a single folder/directory. </p>
		<p>Once you have installed JOA, you should have a folder/directory on your computer with these contents:</p>
		<p>Mac</p>
		<div class="image"> <img alt="List of folders: bathymetry, coastlines, Example Data Files, Java OceanAtlas 5.0, JOA_Support, lexicon.txt, ndeditsettings.txt, temp" src="assets/images/general_install_1.jpg"> </div>
		<p>Windows</p>
		<div class="image"> <img alt="List of folders: bathymetry, coastlines, Example Data Files, Java OceanAtlas 5.0, JOA_Support, lexicon.txt, ndeditsettings.txt, temp" src="assets/images/general_install_2.jpg"> </div>
		<p> Most of these are essential - the JOA application itself will not run without information it looks for in some of the other files - and so all must be co-located in the same folder/directory on your computer. </p>

		<h4>Bathymetry Add-ins</h4>
		<p> The Java OceanAtlas download contains various bathymetry files, including coarse ETOPO-60 (one degree spatial resolution) and medium ETOPO-20 (twenty minute resolution) files. If you would like to add higher-resolution files, <a href="etopo">download</a> any or all of the fine resolution ETOPO-5 files (five minute resolution) and place them (unzipped if your bathymetry file download was zipped) into the JOA_Support folder/subdirectory on your computer. </p>
