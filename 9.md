<p>Again as you know or suspect, most Java OceanAtlas plots can be extensively modified.To change the scale range or other aspects of almost any Java OceanAtlas plot, double-click anywhere inside the content area. You will get a dialog box from which you can alter the scale range and make other changes.<br><br>Are the dots too small on the property-property plots? You can increase the symbol size or change the symbol shape.<br><br>Do you wish a different background color? Single-clicking on a color swatch in a dialog box brings up a color picker, or you can change to 'white' or 'black' plot styles.<br><br>And so forth. The plot will be redrawn in accord with the new set-up information when 'OK' is clicked, or will update in the background if 'Apply' is clicked.</p>
