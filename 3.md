<p>Plots are the heart of the application. One of the first questions you might have would be &lsquo;where are these data located?&rsquo; Java OceanAtlas includes station maps.Select &lsquo;Map...&rsquo; from the Plots menu. The will bring up the Configure Map Plot dialog box. Select the &lsquo;Miller&rsquo; projection from the scrollable list of projections. Select the &lsquo;Central Atlantic&rsquo; preset region. In the 'Latitude spacing (deg)&rsquo; and Longitude spacing (deg)&rsquo; boxes select the pre-set text and type in '10&rsquo; and '20&rsquo;, respectively. Java OceanAtlas maps include default bathymetry based on the ETOPO60 one-degree coarse grid: click the 'bathymetry&rsquo; tab to see this (on a new copy of JOA it is set up this way by default). The dialog box should look like the examples in Figure 2.

<p>Then click 'Plot'. In a few seconds you will see a map with the stations, shaded land masses, gray bathymetry, and a latitude/longitude grid, as shown in Figure 3.

Map plots show individual dots for each station, with a different color for each section (when there are more than one section opened). In Figure 3 the apparent 'cruise line&rsquo; is actually a series of 80 individual station dots. The map window is scrollable and resizable.</p>
