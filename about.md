          <h1>About Java OceanAtlas</h1>
          <p>Java OceanAtlas was developed by scientific programmer John "Oz"
            Osborne (OceanAtlas Software, Vashon, WA, USA), with assistance from data scientist Maria Osborne working
            with
            Dr. James Swift. <a href="assets/documents/Background_of_Java_OceanAtlas.pdf">Read about the Background of

          <h1>About the Data</h1>
          <p>The data on this site were assembled by Dr. James Swift from sources including the CLIVAR and
            Carbon Hydrographic Data Office, the Reid/Mantyla data set, Syd Levitus' World Ocean Atlas data sets, as
            well
            as
            his own research files. A host of talented UCSD undergraduate research assistants prepared data files and
            built
            the site, with assistance from CCHDO technical specialists. <a
