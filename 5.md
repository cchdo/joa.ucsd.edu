title : Changing Color/Contour Bar
css: joa
---
<p>A favorite feature of Java OceanAtlas is the coloring of plotted data by ranges of any parameter for which there are data and for which there is a color/contour bar. We supply an assortment of useful color/contour bars with the application, and we also include a creator/editor sub-application, called the Contour Manager (under the Resources menu). The easiest-to-use feature of the Contour Manager is using it to change color/contour bars, which is what we will do next, because coloring by pressure on a pressure-based plot (as above) added little to that plot.</p>
<ul>
<li>To change the 'colored' parameter (the one shown in the Data Window), pull down the 'Resources' menu and select 'Contour Manager...'(see Figure 6).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This dialog box opens up a host of possibilities, but we'll stick to the easiest: try selecting one of the other color bars provided, for example 'O2 -global.cbr'. You will see the new color bar and contour intervals displayed in the right portion of the Contour Manager (as shown in Figure 6). Click 'Apply' and you will see the plot(s) underneath updated to preview your selection. Try a few others, then return to oxygen. Click 'OK', and all active plots are re-colored, this time by the new color/contour bar (Figure 7).</li>

<p class="oceanography_text">You have added a new dimension to your profile plot. You can see in Figure 7 that the very uppermost waters are relatively high in oxygen concentration, but immediately underneath - above the salinity minimum - there is a strong oxygen minimum, especially in the east. The sluggish circulation in this portion of the water column in this area tends to ventilate the layer slowly, leaving biological debris raining down to use dissolved oxygen as it decays. But in the North Atlantic Deep Water layer at ca. 2500-3000 decibars, especially on the west, dissolved oxygen concentrations are relatively high. This layer is ventilated very effectively in the Labrador Sea and from the dense outflows south from the Nordic Seas. As the layer spreads southward it ventilates a great band of deep water found throughout much of the World Ocean.</p>
